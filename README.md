Annual Changes in Global Temperature Using ARIMA Model

Global warming is becoming a very popular topic for a long period of time.
Because it is closely related to the future of human being and other creatures living on the Earth. 
Many researchers and institutions are focusing on this topic and they provide many available time series data and helpful academic results. 
This project use the data from NASA of annual changes in global temperature. With some background introduction and exploratory data analysis, the main part of this project is confirmatory data analysis based on ARIMA model. 
The three main steps of model construction: model identification, parameter estimation and diagnostic check are detailed presented. An ARIMA(1,1,3) model is carefully selected and fitted . 
After model construction, two brief applications: forecasting and simulation are used to ensure the robustness of model.
